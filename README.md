### Milestone 1 (Data Acquisition and Pre-processing)

For Milestone 1, I have successfully acquired dataset related to urban mobility and traffic patterns, including congestion level, weather conditions, road type and vehicle type. The data acquisition phase involved identifying and sourcing relevant datasets from municipal governments, transportation agencies, and open data repositories to ensure a comprehensive dataset that captures the intricacies of urban mobility patterns.

Subsequently, I conducted initial data cleaning, normalization, and pre-processing steps to enhance data quality, consistency, and readiness for further analysis and visualization. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming the data into a structured format suitable for analysis. These pre-processing steps are crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the analysis, setting a strong foundation for the subsequent stages of the project.

Overall, I have made significant progress towards Milestone 1, laying the groundwork for the interactive data visualization and analysis of urban mobility patterns. The acquired and pre-processed datasets form the backbone of my project, providing a solid starting point for exploring traffic flow dynamics, assessing road efficiency, and examining the correlation between congestion and various factors such as weather and population density.
